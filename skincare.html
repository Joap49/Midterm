      <h3>Our Favorite Drugstore + High-End Skincare Routine</h3>
      <p>by Maya Goyle</p>
      <p class="indent p-color">Hey boobs, Maya here!

I have combination skin which gets oily during the day and dry at night (I hate my life) and in the past I haven’t had the biggest problem with acne, but in the last few months I’ve had mega breakouts on my cheeks and chin that I’ve had the hardest time getting rid of. I’m definitely new to skincare and makeup and still learning the basics, but here are some favorites and tips I’ve picked up along the way!

Let’s start with some skincare I’m loving at the moment.
</p>

      <p class="p-color">I’ve been loyal to Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash: Pink Grapefruit Foaming Scrub for at least 8 years. It’s hands down the BEST cleanser to use at night, it takes off every last bit of my makeup (even when I’m using my Fenty Fly-liner) and leaves my skin feeling super clean and refreshed. I’m obsessed. I just started using Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil before my Neutrogena scrub because I found out about double-cleansing (or oil-cleansing?) The oil-based cleanser wipes out the makeup and oil first and then the second cleanser goes deeper into the pores, etc. I just started trying this out and honestly, I’m pretty happy with the results and the feeling my skin has afterward. My skin feels cleaner but also less completely stripped and dry. My cheek acne has also been clearing up a bit, although it’s hard to pinpoint what to attribute that to. The next part of my nighttime routine that I want to highlight is the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Toner. I just started using this and I’m loving it. It’s a salicylic acid treatment which is always a good ingredient to incorporate into your routine, especially if you have acne concerns like I do. After my toner, I use a hyaluronic acid serum, but honestly, I’m not crazy about it so I’m looking for recs! I feel like if I’m using a hydrating serum, I shouldn’t wake up with my face feeling dry and yet many mornings after the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster I still feel dry. Definitely not putting a photo of that one. The Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate and Daily Reviving Concentrate have been lifesavers for a while too. The Midnight Recovery Concentrate provides me with a lot of hydration that I’m lacking from my serum and helps with the overall smoothness and texture of my face. Normally I don’t love oils but this one doesn’t feel greasy, smells amazing, and applies really nicely. I make sure to use it, especially after doing a clay mask, as it’s one of the few things that helps prevent my skin from drying out completely. The Daily Reviving Concentrate is a good pair and has similar effects for the day, definitely making my skin look more vibrant but also kind of acting as a barrier for my skin throughout the day. Lastly, my moisturizer changes all the time and I have so many that I love. A recent favorite has been Weleda Skin Food, for day or night. I use the light version and it’s still great at night, feeling super enriching and like I’m getting my skin all the right vitamins and ingredients. If I’m feeling extra dry I use the Mario Badescu Seaweed Night Cream. This one’s pretty heavy so I try to use it sparingly and only when I need to, but it’s great for bringing my skin back to life. In the morning I either use Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream: SPF 30 or Skin Food with Supergoop sunscreen on top. If I learned one thing it’s to NEVER leave for the day without SPF on. I prefer Kiehl’s with SPF simply because it’s easier to have two steps in one. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream without SPF is also a huge favorite for night or day. This is just what’s been working for me lately! Tweet me with any recs or comments @mayagoyle!
